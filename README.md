# Doggy Homes

This is the repository for a prototype of a dog adoption website.

The source files are located in "/Docs" folder.
### Files
* [Dogs.json](Docs/dogs.json)
* [Functions.js](Docs/functions.js)
* [Index.html](Docs/index.html)

## .GitIgnore
The .gitignore file is used to tell git what files not to track and include. I am using the .gitignore in this project to ignore the sensitive infromation about the dogs in the [dogs.json](Docs/dogs.json) file.

## Place Holder HTML
The placeholder html was sourced from this link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-starter-template-a-basic-html5-boilerplate-for-index-html/
